		<h3>Zombie Strategies is many things, but it is foremost a place to exercise your wildest imagination.</h3>
		<br />
		<h2 style="margin-bottom:10px; margin-top:10px;">Our Guiding Philosophy</h2>
		<h3>Zombies are quickly becoming a significant pop culture reference, but the appeal of the undead horror genre to zombie fans is often misunderstood by the general public.  We believe the lure towards the genre lies in debating survival strategies.</h3>
		<br/>
		<h3>We love debating zombie survival scenarios and we think that given the chance many more people would share our same passion, so we've tried our best to create an open ended platform for users to work out their own survival strategies.</h3>
		<br />
		<h3>You'll notice that we try hard not to imply what a zombie is or is not, we leave that definition up to you!</h3>
		<br />
